GIT and GITHUB
GIT - 

Version control system (VCS)
1. sharing 
2. versioning

why GIT is popular
popular version control systems before GIT are CVS and SVN
1. CVS - Centralised VCS
2. SVN - Centralised VCS
3. GIT - Distributed VCS
diff between centralised and distributed VCS

dev1 and dev2 used to communicate thorugh centralised control system i.e through SVN/CVS

dev1 can share to distributed control systema and dev2 can pick it or dev1 can make a copy of distribute version control system and call it as distributed system 2. that means developer can created multiple copies of distribution system

FORK - you create an entire copy of distribution system
GIT is open source 

GITHUB is a solution on top of GIT
usability
raising issues
commenting
talking to peers
reviews
project management


terminal
mkdir example.com
vim calculator.sh
x=a+b
:wq!
ls 
git-scm.com
git for linux/windows based on ur os 

git

git init - to create empty git repository

ls -la

.git is the folder the hidden folder to track git activities
ls .git - it will list the files in .git folder it has HEAD, config, hooks, objects and refs
refs - using 
objects - every file created in git is tracked as objectes
hooks - if anyone is unintentionnaly commiting passwords or api tokens, this will prevent such kind of incidents
config - configuring git credentials or secure configuring

git add
git commit
git push

git status

git commit -m "This is myn first version"
git status
vim calculator.sh
x=a+b
y=a-b
git status
ls -la 
.git - this folder has encrypted files which are tracking the project, it can track millions of files also
git status
git diff
git add calculator.sh
git commit -m "This is my second version"
git log
{first version 
x=a+b }
{second version 
x=a+b
y=a-b}

if we want to go back to previous commit i.e first version
git reset --hard <previos-vesion--(you will get this from git log)>


git log
git diff


how to share the code: GITHUB, Bit Bucket and self hosted GIT  - Distributed systems


ex: GITHUB
create an account with GITHUB

github.com
